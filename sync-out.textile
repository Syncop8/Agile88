h1. Sync Out

Sync Out is a 2-day event where we meet up at a off-site location and hack on pet projects and similar. 

Sync Out gives everyone an opportunity to:

* learn and evaluate new technology
* hear about other experiences of techniques and tools
* try out ideas for products
* focus on a task for 2 days
* get to know each other, and people who wish to join Syncopate
* flee family chores ;)

h2. Why is it called Sync Out?

We like the combination of our name and the ‘Out’ variants… chill, drop out. 

h2. Purpose

Part of our idea is to always keep learning new things, and to dedicate 20% of our time to personal development. The Sync Out concept is part of this.
