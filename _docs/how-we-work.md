How Agile88 works - For Clients
===================

1. Create a project brief
-----------------------

Post a project brief that describes what you need help with, the profile of your ideal consultant and other details. It’s a good idea to set expectations around your timeframe and budget to help consultants tailor their proposals to your needs. Your company details are kept confidential and are not visible to consultants.

2. Get matched to the best consultants
-------------------

Our recommendations engine matches your brief with the most relevant consultants. You can also invite Expert360 consultants to apply for the project. Interested and available consultants will submit an application for you to review.

3. Engage quickly and directly
---------------------------

Review the applications, read reviews from former clients and choose who you want to interview and hire. Connect with them directly.

4. Agree Terms
------------------

Once you’re ready to hire, key terms (rates, start date, deliverables, approach etc.) will all be agreed and and recorded on the Agile88 platform. Keep in mind we add a margin to our consultants rates.


5. Work directly with your consultant
-------------------------------------

We encourage you to be clear on deliverables and communicate with the consultant regularly through the project to ensure your expectations are met. The Agile88 team is here to help should you have any questions or concerns.


6. Payment
-------------------------------------
Our standard invoicing cycle is fortnightly throughout the project. You’ll receive regular invoices from Expert360 for the consultants’ work. We accept a range of payment methods (bank deposit, Paypal, credit card).

7. Leave feedback and reviews
-------------------------------------

Help our consultants build their profile and help us improve the Agile88 experience. We value your feedback.
