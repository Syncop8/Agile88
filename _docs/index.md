What is Agile88?
==================

Our Mission
----------------

To enable businesses of all sizes to directly engage top agile, design, software, dev ops and project delivery talent.

Our Story
-------------


We are both career project people. During our time at professional services firms and working for companies both big and small as both consultants and internal staff members, we saw the power of great agile talent when it came to delivering real, innovative outcomes and results.

But getting access to the best was - and still is - difficult. The market for matching people and organisations was, and largely is, highly inefficient. We believed that an online marketplace for great talent would help both organisations and those individuals with powerful skill-sets.

We also noticed that sometimes even good people struggle as independant consultants, and that more and more of them wanted to have more flexibility and choice in the way the work and with whom they work.


What do Agile88ers like in and value?
----------------------------------------

Agile88 is a home for people who like to
(a) bring new digital products to market that make the world a better place
(b) help others to do this in the most effective way possible

We value:

-   \*Community - We like to hang out with people who share our values
-   \*Freedom - We want to control our own time
-   \*Competence - We want to continuously learn
-   \*Good citizenship - Heart over wallet (money isn't the main thing in life)
-   \*Professionalism - We genuinely care about solving our customers problems

We believe these values lead to personal happiness as well as business success.

Basically, we're trying to help people find the magic balance between being someone who makes the world a better place, being an independent consultant (full freedom, no support), and being an employee (little freedom, lots of support).



Our Solution
--------------

We knew that technology would empower a new way of delivering consulting services and we created Agile88.

Agile88 allows businesses to engage top agile talent for project-work. We find the best people, stripped away the overhead and inefficiencies and put it on a digital platform to allow clients and consultants to come together in a flexible way to deliver great work (on-site and remotely).

We bring businesses what they really want â€“ highest quality talent, flexibility in how they engage them, and at a price that delivers great value.

Through the Agile88 platform, businesses of all sizes are now able to:

Engage top people for project-based work, removing the need to hire a whole team, reducing cost, and giving businesses the freedom to choose experienced consultants that suit them.
Receive extensive client support and an easy to follow step-by-step process, ensuring that businesses are able to complete projects and access experienced consultants quickly and efficiently.
At the same time, we wanted to provide consultants with an end to end solution that enables them to work more flexibly and source projects that made them tick, without all the hassle of managing contracts, invoicing and payments.

Through the Agile88 platform, consultants are able to:

Do what they love everyday by selecting projects that leverage their skills and interest them the most.
Effortlessly manage their own workflow without having to worry about contracts and invoices as everything is managed through the online platform.
Grow their professional network by connecting with like minded consultants and businesses seeking individuals with their unique background and experience.
