h1. Visions

One big aha in our evolution was when we that Syncopate itself is just a platform. Syncopate doesn't have a Vision (with a Big V), we just want to be a "nice home for consultants":what-is-syncopate.html.

However, many of the _people_ at Syncopate do have a vision. Here are the most widely shared visions:

*Vision 1: "Help companies benefit from Lean/Agile/Design Thinking/Motivated people"*

*Vision 2: "Develop companies and organizations so the people there can be happy, improve, and create increasing value."*

PS: that doesn't mean we're all coaches. See "our business":our-business.html.

h2. Why do we have multiple visions?

Because people don't all have to want the same thing. We're in this home together because we have a common set of values, not because we have to have the same vision and goals. People can work on whatever they are passionate about, and if enough other Syncopaters share the same passion it implicitly becomes a  vision.

h2. How we work with visions

We're guided by these principles (which we agreed upon on one of our "unconferences":unconference.html):

* We can have several visions.
* They can and should be changed, so everyone can discuss.
