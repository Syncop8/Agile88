Frequently Asked Questions
=========================

What do we do?
--------------------------

Agile88 is an online platform that connects businesses with a global network of top independent agile consultants for project based work.

How does it work for clients?
-----------------------------

Our secure, easy to use platform takes care of everything. Simply:

* Post a project - Describe what you need, your objectives, and the profile of your ideal candidate.
* Interview - Experienced consultants pitch to you. You can review their suitability, and interview your top picks to find the best fit.
* Pick the best fit - No need to worry about contracts, invoicing, or payments - everything is handled through the platform.
* We aim to provide awesome people. Hire awesome or don't hire at all is our motto.

For more details see [How it works for clients](./how-it-works-clients.html).

What sort of projects get posted on Agile88?
----------------


Our consultants cater primarily to agile projects of all sizes. They  specialize in UX, software development, dev ops, agile coaching, project and program delivery. Projects typically fall into one of the following categories:

* UX design work
* Software development
* Agile coaching
* Dev ops work
* Agile project delivery at scale
* Project Set-up or turnaround


What sort of people will you find on Agile88?
----------------

Our minimum bar is:

1.  The candidate is awesome, a ninja. That is, we are confident that the candidate will have happy clients.
2.  The candidate is social, and people actually *like* and *recommend* the person and look forward to hanging out 
3.  At least one us has worked with the candidate before (and can therefore testify to the first two points). We want someone to say "Hey, I've worked with her before, she's awesome! You'd be IDIOTS not to hire her!"

This considerably limits the number of applicants.

Other things that we value (but don't always require):

-   The candidate complements our network somehow, for example with new skills or perspectives that we lack. He/she will make us feel like newbies in some area!
-   The candidate has lots of energy and ideas, and won't be shy to challenge the status quo.
-   The candidate is well known and has a strong reputation in the industry.
-   

> Tips to candidates: Inspire us! Inspire your potential clients! Show us your skills, technical and social! Present something new and exciting on a blog post, video or conference. We all need to be convinced you are good at what you do. Why? Because we want the clients to rave over how awesome you are.


Who is responsible for delivering work?
-------------------------------

Consultants are responsible for scoping and delivering work for clients. It is clearly set out in our [Terms & Conditions] (t_c.html) that consultants are independent contractors and Agile88 is not responsible for deliverables or the quality of work.

On the occasion where it is not working out with a particular consultant after work has commenced, Agile88 offers a replacement guarantee. For placements of individual consultants or teams, we will replace consultants ASAP at no additional cost within the first two weeks of a project.

We ask clients to adhere to providing fair notice of termination for consultants. Our policy is a notice period of 2 days if the project is less than 4 weeks and a notice period of 1 week if the project is greater than 4 weeks, to balance providing you flexibility and fairness for consultants who have committed their time to working for you.

How long does it take to secure a consultant?
----------------------------------------

On average, it takes 2 days to hire a consultant. However, it's common for people to find the right match within 24 hours. If your requirements are urgent, please get in touch with our team at projects@agile88.com or on 1300 blah blah.


How do I offer and accept a contract?
----------------------------------------

After you have interviewed suitable consultants for your project and have verbally communicated with the chosen consultant that you would like to move ahead, the next step is offer a contract through the Agile88 platform. The contract will officially scope the project deliverables, timeframes and budgets and is a good reference point to set out your agreement. 

Once you and the consultant have accepted the contract, you are ready to commence work. You may provide additional agreements relevant to your own organization directly to the consultant, however an Agile88 contract is required so Agile88 can process payments in-line with your agreed terms. It also forms as a key component of Agile88â€™s Terms and Conditions and Pricing and Payment Terms.


Do I pay by the day, hour, week, other?
----------------------------------------

You can specify how you'd like to bill when you post a project. If you know how long the work will take, or if it's a one-off with clear deliverables, it's best to specify a project value. Or, if you don't know what's involved, it's best to specify an hourly or daily rate.


What are our fees?
----------------------------------------

We charge a base fee of 15% - 20%, depending on the duration and complexity of the project, on top of our consultant rates. Where you wish to hire a consultant on a permanent basis and take the relationship outside Agile88, we charge an introduction fee of 15% of the annual remuneration package. Please refer to our introductions fee policy for more detail.


What insurance do Agile88ers have?
----------------------------------------

Many Agile88 consultants have their own Professional Indemnity and Public Liability insurance, and we encourage consultants to have this in place. Consultants (other than sole traders) are required to have workers compensation insurance in place.

You should inquire with consultants to make sure they have the level of insurance you are comfortable with.


What kind of people fit in at Agile88
----------------------------------------

Most people who end up here were previously independent consultants (or were heading in that direction). Typical personality traits:

-   **Self-confident** - they know that they are highly skilled and in high demand.
-   **Adventurous** - a few months without an assignment isn't the end of the world, it's an opportunity to play around and learn new stuff!
-   **Social** - they like to maintain a strong network and collaborate with people. Some of us are introverts, but still kind of social :o)
-   **Curious** - want to learn new things, every day. Love geeking out on new technologies, processes, etc.
-   **Generous** - like to share what they learn, not primarily for profit but because it's fun and rewarding in itself.
-   **Responsible** - they're used to taking responsibility for their own goals and actions, and don't wait for others to tell them what to do or solve their problems.

Of course, not everyone has all these traits. But this is typically the type of person who is attracted to us.


How does on-boarding work?
--------------------------

Welcome! You'll need to sign our team contract and create your own personal company (if you don't already have one). Formally you'll be employed by your company, not us. We'll help you get started.

Congrats, you are now your own manager! Be nice.

We'll proudly display you on our site.
